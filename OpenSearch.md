### 1. Compliance-Ready Kubernetes: Using Logs, Policies, and Git with KubeAid

Compliance in Kubernetes is often handled through manual checks, spreadsheets, and ad-hoc audits - approaches that don’t scale as clusters grow and environments multiply. In this talk, we’ll explore how to build compliance-ready Kubernetes clusters using logs, policies, and GitOps with KubeAid.

We’ll walk through a practical compliance model where Git acts as the source of truth, policies are enforced continuously, and operational signals such as audit logs, security events, and configuration changes are made observable by default. Using KubeAid, we’ll show how common compliance requirements - like access control, runtime vulnerability scanning, workload isolation, and secret handling etc. - can be implemented consistently across clusters without relying on manual processes.

The talk will cover how GitOps workflows, policy engines, identity integrations, and observability components work together to make compliance repeatable and verifiable, rather than reactive.
